# OSPF, a blazing fast Javascript single-page framework

## Overview ##
OSPF makes easy to create single pages JavaScript apps, by using components as stand-alone rendered objects, in a MVC-way.

## Getting started ##
Clone this repository inside a folder accessible by your webserver:

` git clone https://github.com/omagerio/ospf.git `

Visit the URL of that folder, for example ` http://localhost/myfolder `

Et voil√†. The framework is up and running strong. Easy right?

# Application flow #
The application starts from the `index.js` file you can find in the root of the project. A function named `appInit` will be called when the framework is ready. For example, the default:

```javascript
async function appInit() {
    let main = await HelloWorld.Create();
    root.addChild("main", main);
}
```

This code should be self explanatory.

The `root` is a special component, globally accessible, and it is the root of your application.
The method "addChild" adds a child to the selected component, and accepts the component being created, and the key of the component.
Read more about components below.
`main` is the only possible child of the root component.

Ok now the `HelloWorld` component will be rendered when you start the application.

## Folder structure ##

```

## Creating components ##
An example component was made for you to start with.
You can find it inside `ospf/components/custom/HelloWorld`.

- Clone the `HelloWorld` folder with a new name, `myComponent`

Inside this folder, you can find a JS and an HTML file. The js is, surprisingly, the logic of this component. The HTML is the template.

- Rename both files to `myComponent.js` and `myComponent.htm`

- Open the `myComponent.js`

Inside this file you can find a class extending the `Component` class.

- Rename this class to what you want, for example `MyComponent`.

```javascript
class MyComponent extends Component {
	// ...
}
```

You are almost there. Now we have to tell OSPF about your new component, but do not worry, it is faster than you think.

- Open `ospf/components_custom.js` and add `custom/MyComponent` the array.
```javascript
var customComponents = [
	"custom/HelloWorld",
	"custom/MyComponent"
];
```

The HTML file represents the template of the component. Let's see the default tpl:
```html
<div id="<%= c._id %>" class="helloWorld">
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <h3>This is a test component.</h3>
    ...
</div>
```

Here you place the HTML of your panel. Be sure to set the `id` attribute of the tag (can be any tag you want, here is a `div`) to `<%- c.id %>` to allow the framework to recognize the component later on.

> As you can see, this framework uses the extraordinary `ejs` library. Find more here: https://ejs.co/

### Component methods ###
Components have different methods you must know:

- `static async Create()`: this is a fundamental method of the components. Always call this method to create a component.
- `renderEvent(string eventName, any parameters, Event javascriptEvent)`: renders an event, for example: `onclick="<%- c.renderEvent("clickHandler") %>"` will call `component.clickHandler(parameters, javascriptEvent)`.
- `async databind()`: loads panel data. You _must_ override this function (and call `super.databind()`) inside your component when you have to load data required from your tpl.
- `async refresh()`: refreshes the component's template. You should never override this method.
- `async update()`: calls `refresh()` and `databind()` sequentially. You should never override this method.
- `render()`: returns the HTML of the component. Use this method inside your template to render children components.
- `addChild(name, component)`: adds a child component to the current component.
- `getChild(name)`: get the child of the current component by name.
- `removeChild(name)`: get the child of the current component by name.

Inside the template file, you can use `c` to reference your component.

### Other methods ###
- `async parseInput()`: parses user input to update components status. It is automatically called when an event is handled. Must call `await super.parseInput()` inside.
- `async onFirstRender()`: called when the component is rendered for the first time.
- `async onBeforeRefresh()`: called before the component is refreshed.
- `async onAfterRefresh()`: called after the component is refreshed.
- `createId(string)`: creates an unique id for this component based on `string`.
- `async loadFile()`: loads an html file.

### Core components ###
```
AjaxRequest
Component
Label
ListBox
TextBox
```

### Compiling ###
By default, components are loaded one by one when the application start. You can speed up the startup process by compiling your components in one single file.
You can use `tools/compile.js` to perform this operation (requires nodejs and an internet connection):
`node tools/compile.js`

Now you have to tell OSPF to use the compiled version of your components. Open un `index.js` and set:
```javascript
/*
    Set to "false" if you want to test your application without compiling or you don't have nodeJS.
    Set to "true" and run "node tools/compile.js" to generate unified sources. Recommended.
*/
const PRODUCTION_MODE = true;
```

### That's all folks ###
This is everything you must know if you want to start using OSPF!

Happy coding
